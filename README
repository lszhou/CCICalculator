                Charlson Comorbidity Scoring Program

--------------------------
Introduction and Statement
--------------------------
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is an index for estimating prognosis for dialysis
Patients. This program is a tool used to calculate the amount of disease burden a 
subject is carrying at any point in time. It is actually a java implementation of 
the functionalities shown by the following web page: http://touchcalc.com/calculators/cci_js

The functionalities includes 

1) Collecting the user information (Age, Serum Albumin Value) and their answers 
to different questions interactively; 

2) Error and exception checking; 

3) Display the the estimated prognosis (CCI Survival, etc) via console.
